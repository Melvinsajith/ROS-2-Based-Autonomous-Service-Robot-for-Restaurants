ROS 2-Based Autonomous Service Robot for Restaurants


This repository contains the source code, simulation models, and documentation for a ROS 2-based autonomous mobile robot designed to deliver food in a simulated restaurant environment. Built using **ROS 2 Humble**, **Gazebo 11 Classic**, **SLAM Toolbox**, **Nav2**, and a custom **Python-Tkinter GUI**, this project demonstrates a modular and realistic service robot system suitable for hospitality automation.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Modern restaurants face challenges such as high labor costs, inconsistent service, and the need for contactless delivery. This project presents a robotic solution that autonomously navigates a restaurant layout to deliver food to predefined tables using real-time mapping and navigation technologies.

## 🔧 Features

- 🤖 Differential drive robot modeled using URDF/Xacro  
- 🗺️ SLAM Toolbox for real-time mapping and localization  
- 🧭 Nav2 for dynamic path planning and obstacle avoidance  
- 🖥️ Custom GUI built with Tkinter for goal setting and status monitoring  
- 🧪 Full simulation in Gazebo 11 Classic with realistic restaurant layout  
- 🧠 Modular launch system for simulation, SLAM, navigation, and GUI control
